Make background pure black, then the code windows are transparent and the text is neon blue

typing effect on content

add some code snippets using external libs for fun

add some animations

add some transitions

maybe add a star background

instead of typing effect, use an on hover then the text fades in

make a button that puts all content onto 1 page instead of a dynamic layout
